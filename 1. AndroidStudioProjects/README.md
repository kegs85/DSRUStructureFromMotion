# DSRUStructureFromMotion - 1. Android Studio projects
Several android studio projects noted as a work in progress, attempts to restore some older projects to a working state (e.g. SceneRecon, canarvaeza/SFM) and tests in operating basic OpenCV functions.

Ultimately Android solutions were abandoned due to technical difficulties in achieving a functional solution in the timeframe.  These may be revisited at a later date.
