# DSRUStructureFromMotion - 3. Test Project Files - Hand
An attempt at anatomy measurement, using a coin as reference
Test project files have been added to allow you to have a look at what can be created without having to setup a working version.
* Original images contains the photos used to construct the 3D model.
* Measurements contains some reference photos displaying the actual measurements of some of the objects in question
* output_file.ply is the dense point cloud - you can open this in MeshLAB
* noted issues with plain white background (noisy)
* coin difficult to distinguish with noise
* View1 of output_file.ply in MeshLAB is a screenshot of the dense point cloud in MeshLAB
* View2 of output_file.ply in MeshLAB is a screenshot of the dense point cloud in MeshLAB with a second viewpoint
