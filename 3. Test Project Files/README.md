# DSRUStructureFromMotion - 3. Test Project Files

Test project files have been added to allow you to have a look at what can be created without having to setup a working version.
* Original images contains the photos used to construct the 3D model.
* Measurements contains some reference photos displaying the actual measurements of some of the objects in question
* output_file.ply is the dense point cloud - you can open this in MeshLAB
* same standard files in both projects (hand and case)

## Hand
An attempt at anatomy measurement, using a coin as reference
* noted issues with plain white background (noisy)
* coin difficult to distinguish with noise
* View1 of output_file.ply in MeshLAB is a screenshot of the dense point cloud in MeshLAB
* View2 of output_file.ply in MeshLAB is a screenshot of the dense point cloud in MeshLAB with a second viewpoint


## Case
Inanimate object used to improve accuracy of measurements in testing
* Created (3D print) marker in contrasting colour for differentiation.
* Used cardboard background with substance to prevent noise (easier for the processing to recognise)
* Some noise present (note some objects in background in original images)
* MeshLAB Project files included with set scale to mm for easy review
